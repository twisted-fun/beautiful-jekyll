### Challenge: [guestbook](../ctfs/tuctf17/pwn/guestbook/guestbook)
(**PS**: *libc was provided for this challenge*)

### Reversing
Let's start with basic analysis of given binary
```bash
$ file ./guestbook
guestbook: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=bc73592d4897267cd1097b0541dc571d051a7ca0, not stripped
$ checksec ./guestbook
    Arch:     i386-32-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      PIE enabled
```
So we have PIE and NX enabled
