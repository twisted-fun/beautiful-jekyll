### Challenge: Cat Chat

### Description
You discover this cat enthusiast chat app, but the annoying thing about it is that you're always banned when you start talking about dogs. Maybe if you would somehow get to know the admin's password, you could fix that.  

[https://cat-chat.web.ctfcompetition.com/](https://cat-chat.web.ctfcompetition.com/)  

### First look
When opening the challenge URL, we are quickly make a few observations
- Its a chat application
- We are assigned a random nickname
- Redirected URL is having a unique chat room id
- Rules section stats that `Dog talk` can get you banned
- `/name new_nick` can be used to change your nickname
- `/report` can be used to inform admin about users doing `Dog talk` and get them banned
- Lastly we also have source code for `server.js` provided

### Goal Assumptions
From the challenge description we can make out that we need to get access of admin's password/session. Looking at the application, we can make our first guess that we have to perform client side attack like XSS in order to get session of admin user.
So with this goal in mind lets start the assessment of the application.

### Bug hunting

#### Getting Familiar with the app

Lets execute chat room commands  
Execution of `/name hacker` results in  

![name execution](../ctfs/gctf18/web/cat_chat-210/name_execution.png)

Execution of `/report` results in

![report execution](../ctfs/gctf18/web/cat_chat-210/report_execution.png)

This is definitely interesting. When we report to admin, admin joins the chat room. Now this challenge is giving more feels for XSS.

Lets try to ban someone using `dog talks`. To do this we can open a normal window and an incognito window in same browser. In both visit the same chat room. In incognito window, first send `/report` command to make admin join chat room. Then in same window, send `dog` as message.
It will look something like below. (*Window in right is the incognito one*)  

![report execution](../ctfs/gctf18/web/cat_chat-210/report_execution.png)

We also notice that when a person gets banned he can no longer send messages to the chat room. There is also a change in color for the nickname of user who got banned.

#### Looking into Page Source

Let's look at the page source. We can see there is a comment describing additional `Admin commands` for chat room.  

**Admin commands**:
- `/secret asdfg` - Sets the admin password (*that we have to steal*) to be sent to the server with each command for authentication. It's enough to set it once a year, so no need to issue a /secret command every time you open a chat room.
- `/ban UserName` - Bans the user with UserName from the chat (requires the correct admin password to be set) (*meaning we cannot directly ban someone, -_-*)  

Other than this comment we can see there is `catchat.js` is also used here. We will take a look at this afterwards first let's see how `/secret` and `/ban` commands are behaving in the chat room.

#### Checking behavior of admin commands
Lets execute both in our chat room to see how they work.  
Execution of `/secret 1g0ts3cr3t5` results in  

![secret execution](../ctfs/gctf18/web/cat_chat-210/secret_execution.png)  

Okay, so it changes our secret and prints masked secret like ****** on the webpage. But if you look in inspect element, you see your new secret `1g0ts3cr3t5` as value of attribute `data-secret`.  

![information disclosure](../ctfs/gctf18/web/cat_chat-210/info_leak.png)

This is an interesting test case, we can check if other users in the same room can see this message. But sadly, as we can see below, they cannot.  

![probing secret](../ctfs/gctf18/web/cat_chat-210/probing_secret.png)  

But still it's an **information disclosure**, we might need use of afterwards.

#### Taking a look at server
We also have access to `server.js`, from there we can see how these commands are handled. I will break down important parts of the source code in order to explain better :)  

**Some libraries imported**
```
const http = require('http');
const express = require('express');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser')
const uuidv4 = require('uuid/v4');
const SSEClient = require('sse').Client;
const admin = require('./admin');
const pubsub = require('@google-cloud/pubsub')();
```
Oh admin.js *hmm* but we don't have access to it.

**Some initializations** (*Nothing interesting..*)
```
const app = express();
app.set('etag', false);
app.use(cookieParser());
```

**Oh Authorization Check** (*Interesting*)
```
// Check if user is admin based on the 'flag' cookie, and set the 'admin' flag on the request object
app.use(admin.middleware);
```
As we don't have access to `admin.js` the comment helps us understand that when admin sends a request to server it will contain a `flag` cookie whose value will be checked by `admin.middleware`. If the `flag` value is correct `admin` flag will be set on the request object to be used later in the code.

**Banned status check**
```
// Check if banned
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  if (req.cookies.banned) {
    res.sendStatus(403);
    res.end();
  } else {
    next();
  }
});
```
So if a set `banned` cookie is found in our browser session we will get a `403` status.

**Commands handling** (*part we were waiting for*)
```
// Process incoming messages
app.all(roomPath + '/send', async function(req, res) {
  let room = req.params.room, {msg, name} = req.query, response = {}, arg;
  console.log(`${room} <-- (${name}):`, msg)
  if (!(req.headers.referer || '').replace(/^https?:\/\//, '').startsWith(req.headers.host)) {
    response = {type: "error", error: 'CSRF protection error'};
  } else if (msg[0] != '/') {
    broadcast(room, {type: 'msg', name, msg});
  } else {
    switch (msg.match(/^\/[^ ]*/)[0]) {
      case '/name':
        if (!(arg = msg.match(/\/name (.+)/))) break;
        response = {type: 'rename', name: arg[1]};
        broadcast(room, {type: 'name', name: arg[1], old: name});
      case '/ban':
        if (!(arg = msg.match(/\/ban (.+)/))) break;
        if (!req.admin) break;
        broadcast(room, {type: 'ban', name: arg[1]});
      case '/secret':
        if (!(arg = msg.match(/\/secret (.+)/))) break;
        res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', 'flag=' + arg[1] + '; Path=/; Max-Age=31536000');
        response = {type: 'secret'};
      case '/report':
        if (!(arg = msg.match(/\/report (.+)/))) break;
        var ip = req.headers['x-forwarded-for'];
        ip = ip ? ip.split(',')[0] : req.connection.remoteAddress;
        response = await admin.report(arg[1], ip, `https://${req.headers.host}/room/${room}/`);
    }
  }
  console.log(`${room} --> (${name}):`, response)
  res.json(response);
  res.status(200);
  res.end();
});
```
Here is the breakdown of the code
- All requests hitting `/send` are handled by this
- Has a CSRF check that if `Referer` header is not same as request `host` then throw a CSRF protection error
- If `msg` does not have any command broadcast the message in the chat room
- `/name` broadcast the name changing instruction to the room (*hmm ok*)
- `/ban` checks for `req.admin` flag (*It is set in above code if right flag cookie is found in request*) and broadcast user banning instruction to the room (*hmm ok*)
- `/secret` (*Whoa!*) if you see carefully here, you will notice there is a **cookie injection**. Not sure how we can use this bug to get admin `flag` cookie but we will keep it in mind. (*nice!*)
- `/report` uses `admin.report` function to notify admin. It uses `x-forwarded-for` ip in the function. As we don't know how function is using it, for now I will assume it's for logging purposes.  
Thing to note here is that there is **no input sanitization** in place.
In the end it returns response in json format. (*cool*)  
    
#### Figuring out client side

There is a lot of code we can read here. But we understand overall functionality so reading important parts should be enough. Now as we are getting XSS style vibes from this challenge let's check if there is any output encoding in place.

**Escape function**
```
let esc = (str) => str.replace(/</g, '&lt;').replace(/>/g, '&gt;').replace(/"/g, '&quot;').replace(/'/g, '&apos;');
```
So there is some sort of output encoding. But its only looking for `<`, `>`, `"` and `'`. Let's all the entry points if we can inject something.

**Output handling**
```
// Receiving messages
function handle(data) {
  ({
    undefined(data) {},
    error(data) { display(`Something went wrong :/ Check the console for error message.`); console.error(data); },
    name(data) { display(`${esc(data.old)} is now known as ${esc(data.name)}`); },
    rename(data) { localStorage.name = data.name; },
    secret(data) { display(`Successfully changed secret to <span data-secret="${esc(cookie('flag'))}">*****</span>`); },
    msg(data) {
      let you = (data.name == localStorage.name) ? ' (you)' : '';
      if (!you && data.msg == 'Hi all') send('Hi');
      display(`<span data-name="${esc(data.name)}">${esc(data.name)}${you}</span>: <span>${esc(data.msg)}</span>`);
    },
    ban(data) {
      if (data.name == localStorage.name) {
        document.cookie = 'banned=1; Path=/';
        sse.close();
        display(`You have been banned and from now on won't be able to receive and send messages.`);
      } else {
        display(`${esc(data.name)} was banned.<style>span[data-name^=${esc(data.name)}] { color: red; }</style>`);
      }
    },
  })[data.type](data);
}
```
Now if we look at this code all the entry points are escaped using `esc()`. So it should be safe right? Well guess again, in `ban()` when user is banned and it `display`s `${esc(data.name)} was banned.<style>span[data-name^=${esc(data.name)}] { color: red; }</style>`. Here if you notice carefully, we can do a **css injection** in value of `data-name` attribute because characters like `]`, `}`, `:` and `;` are not escaped. This will be quite useful now.
