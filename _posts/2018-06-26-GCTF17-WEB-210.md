### Challenge: Cat Chat

### Description
You discover this cat enthusiast chat app, but the annoying thing about it is that you're always banned when you start talking about dogs. Maybe if you would somehow get to know the admin's password, you could fix that.  

https://cat-chat.web.ctfcompetition.com/  

### First look
When opening the challenge URL, we are quickly make a few observations
- Its a chat application
- We are assigned a random nickname
- Redirected URL is having a unique chat room id
- Rules section stats that "Dog talk" can get you banned
- `/name new_nick` can be used to change your nickname
- `/report` can be used to inform admin about users doing `Dog talk` and get them banned
